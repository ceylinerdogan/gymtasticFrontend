PLACEHOLDER FILE

Currently, the app is configured to work with these three exercise videos:

1. squat-demo.mp4
2. plank-demo.mp4  
3. lunge-demo.mp4

To test the video preview functionality:

1. Place your three exercise videos in this directory
2. Make sure they are named exactly as shown above
3. Use MP4 format for best compatibility
4. Each video should demonstrate proper form for the exercise

For development/testing purposes, you can also:
- Use stock videos from free sources like Pexels, Pixabay, or Unsplash
- Create simple animated GIFs and convert them to MP4
- Use screen recording software to record exercise demonstrations from YouTube

The app will automatically look for these three files when displaying exercise previews.
All workouts will use combinations of these three exercises based on the workout category.
